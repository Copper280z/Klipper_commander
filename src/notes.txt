trsync - endstop - stepper behavior
trsync obj is allocated
trsync is configured and started with one cmd
    report_clock
    report_ticks
    expire_reason

endstop_home is called which sets the endstop up to trigger the trsync object
    trigger conditions are how many ticks the stop pin must be high

stepper is commanded to stop when the trsync triggers (for any reason?) this links the stepper and trsync

?? the trsync object sends periodic responses to the host while active ??


**process runs**

when the endstop pin is triggered, it triggers the trsync object
 which in turn stops the motor and clears the motion queue
    -klipper uses callback functions for this.
    -once triggered the trsync obj sends a response to the host
    -once triggered the endstop sends a response to the host
